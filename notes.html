                        The game autosaves every time you navigate to a node/finish viewing one.

                        On the PSX version Authorize User starts a new game, and Load Data loads an already
                        saved game. In lainTSX Authorize User will start a new game OR load an existing one if
                        it is present, only overriding the player name. I felt that this was more
                        intuitive.<br /><br />
                        You can reset your save file from the options menu in the top right corner.

                        If it's your first time playing the game, loading it might take a while. Subsequent
                        website visits will be much faster once the browser caches all the assets. Be aware
                        that gameplay already starts at the "Authorize User/Load data" screen, it's not a
                        loading screen.

                    <div>
                        Browsers require user permission to autoplay audio. If you're not hearing any sound
                        effects, just click somewhere around the page.<br /><br />
                        We've also had an issue where the player left the game idle for 30~ mins, and the
                        browser's autoplay permissions reset. Again, if this happens to you, just click around
                        the page and it'll get fixed.

                        You can change the language of the subtitles, rebind the keys, and export/import the
                        save file and more using the options menu by clicking the button at the top right
                        corner.
